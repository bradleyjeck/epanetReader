# epanetReader

epanetReader is an R package for reading water network simulation data in
Epanet's .inp and .rpt formats into R.  Some basic summary information and
plots are also provided.   

Epanet is a highly popular tool for water network simulation. It can difficult
to access network information for subsequent analysis and visualization. This
is a real strength of R however, and there many tools already existing in R to
support analysis and visualization.  

Reading an .inp or .rpt file creates an s3 object which can be used with the
usual generic methods. 

The package is also useful in conjunction with the ggplot2 and animation
packages. 

## Installation 

So far the package is only available on GitHub. The plan is to eventually submit to CRAN.

## Getting Started 

# Network files 

Read network information from an .inp file with a similar syntax as the popular read.table or read.csv functions.  

```R
>n1 <- read.inp("Net1.inp") 
```

Retrieve summary information about the network.
```R 
>summary(n1)
$Title
[1] "EPANET Example Network 1"                                  
[2] "A simple example of modeling chlorine decay. Both bulk and"
[3] "wall reactions are included."                              

$entryCounts
            Number
Junctions        9
Tanks            1
Reservoirs       1
Pipes           12
Pumps            1
Coordinates     11

attr(,"class")
[1] "summary.epanet.inp"
```

A basic network plot is also available
```R
>plot(n1)
```
![Net 1 plot](https://github.com/bradleyjeck/epanetReader/blob/master/img/Net1inp.png)

The read.inp function returns an object with structure similar to the .inp file
itself. A section in the .inp file corresponds to a named entry in the list.
These entries are accessed using the $ syntax of R.
```R
> names(n1)
 [1] "Title"       "Junctions"   "Tanks"       "Reservoirs"  "Pipes"      
 [6] "Pumps"       "Valves"      "Patterns"    "Curves"      "Energy"     
[11] "Times"       "Options"     "Coordinates"
```

Sections of the .inp file are stored as a data.frame or character vector. For
example, the junction table is stored as a data.frame and retrieved as follows.
In this case patterns were not specified in the junction table and so are
marked NA.
```R
> n1$Junctions
  ID Elevation Demand Pattern
1 10       710      0      NA
2 11       710    150      NA
3 12       700    150      NA
4 13       695    100      NA
5 21       700    150      NA
6 22       695    200      NA
7 23       690    150      NA
8 31       700    100      NA
9 32       710    100      NA
```

A summary of the junction table shows that Net1.inp has nine junctions with
elevations ranging from 690 to 710 and demands ranging from 0 to 200. Note that
the node ID is stored as a character rather than an integer or factor.  
```R
> summary(n1$Junctions)
      ID              Elevation         Demand      Pattern       
 Length:9           Min.   :690.0   Min.   :  0.0   Mode:logical  
 Class :character   1st Qu.:695.0   1st Qu.:100.0   NA's:9        
 Mode  :character   Median :700.0   Median :150.0                 
                    Mean   :701.1   Mean   :122.2                 
                    3rd Qu.:710.0   3rd Qu.:150.0                 
                    Max.   :710.0   Max.   :200.0                 
```

## Simulation Results 

Results of the network simulation specified in Net.inp may be stored in
Net1.rpt by running Epanet from the command line. Note that the report section
of the .inp file should contain the following lines in order to generate output
readable by this package.   

>[REPORT]
>Page 0
>Links All
>Nodes All 

On windows, calling the epanet executable epanet2d runs the simulation. 
```
>epanet2d Net1.inp Net1.rpt 

... EPANET Version 2.0

  o Retrieving network data
  o Computing hydraulics 
  o Computing water quality
  o Writing output report to Net1.rpt

... EPANET completed.
```  

The .rpt file generated by Epanet may be read into R using read.rpt().  The
simulation is summarized over junctions, tanks and pipes. 
```R
>n1r <- read.rpt("Net1.rpt") 
>summary(n1r)
Contains node results for  25 time steps

The default plot of simulation results is a map for time period 00:00:00. Note that the
object created from the .inp file is a required argument to make the plot. 
```R
plot( n1r, n1)
```
![Net 1 plot](https://github.com/bradleyjeck/epanetReader/blob/master/img/Net1rpt.png)

In contrast to the treatment of .inp files described above, data from .rpt
files is stored using a slightly different structure than the .rpt file.  The
function returns an object (list) with a data.frame for node results and
data.frame for link results.  These two data frames contain results from all
the time periods.  This storage choice was made to facilitate time series plots. 

Entries in the epanet.rpt object (list) created by read.rpt() are found using the names() function. 
```R
> names(n1r)
[1] "nodeResults" "linkResults"
```

Results for a chosen time period can be retrieved using the subset function.
```R
> subset(n1r$nodeResults, Timestamp == "0:00:00")

A comparison with the corresponding entry of the .rpt file, shown below for
reference, shows that four columns have been added to the table. These pieces of extra 
info make visualizing the results easier.
